Deleting a git commit
How to

When working with Git you will find that sometimes commits need to be…

When working with Git you will find that sometimes commits need to be removed as they have introduced a bug or need to be reworked.

If it is the last commit this is very straight forward. Simply run:

git reset HEAD^

This will pop off the latest commit but leave all of your changes to the files intact.

If you need to delete more than just the last commit there are two methods you can use. The first is using rebase this will allow you to remove one or more consecutive commits the other is cherry-pick which allows you to remove non consecutive commits.
Example git log
Number 	Hash 	Commit Message 	Author
1 	2c6a45b 	(HEAD) Adding public method to access protected method 	Tom
2 	ae45fab 	Updates to database interface 	Contractor 1
3 	77b9b82 	Improving database interface 	Contractor 2
4 	3c9093c 	Merged develop branch into master 	Tom
5 	b3d92c5 	Adding new Event CMS Module 	Paul
6 	7feddbb 	Adding CMS class and files 	Tom
7 	a809379 	Adding project to Git 	Tom
Using Rebase

Using the git log above we want to remove the following commits; 2 & 3 (ae45fab & 77b9b82). As they are consecutive commits we can use rebase.

git rebase --onto <branch name>~<first commit number to remove> <branch name>~<first commit to be kept> <branch name>

e.g to remove commits 2 & 3 above

git rebase --onto repair~3 repair~1 repair
Using Cherry Pick

Step 1: Find the commit before the commit you want to remove git log

Step 2: Checkout that commit git checkout <commit hash>

Step 3: Make a new branch using your current checkout commit git checkout -b <new branch>

Step 4: Now you need to add the commit after the removed commit git cherry-pick <commit hash>

Step 5: Now repeat Step 4 for all other commits you want to keep.

Step 6: Once all commits have been added to your new branch and have been commited. Check that everything is in the correct state and working as intended. Double check everything has been commited: git status

Step 7: Switch to your broken branch git checkout <broken branch>

Step 8: Now perform a hard reset on the broken branch to the commit prior to the one your want to remove git reset --hard <commit hash>

Step 9: Merge your fixed branch into this branch git merge <branch name>

Step 10: Push the merged changes back to origin. WARNING: This will overwrite the remote repo! git push --force origin <branch name>

You can do the process without creating a new branch by replacing Step 2 & 3 with Step 8 then not carry out Step 7 & 9.
Example

Say we want to remove commits 2 & 4 from the repo.

    git checkout b3d92c5 Checkout the last usable commit.
    git checkout -b repair Create a new branch to work on.
    git cherry-pick 77b9b82 Run through commit 3.
    git cherry-pick 2c6a45b Run through commit 1.
    git checkout master Checkout master.
    git reset --hard b3d92c5 Reset master to last usable commit.
    git merge repair Merge our new branch onto master.
    git push --hard origin master Push master to the remote repo.

Final note

Git rebase & cherrypick are dangerous but powerful solutions that should only be used as a last option and only be undertaken by someone who knows what they are doing.  Beware that both solutions could have adverse effects on other users who are working on the same repository / branch.

Finally remember to be careful and good luck!
Access - a membership platform for Broadsheet Media
News

Our work in Australia continues, with the launch of the exciting new membership program - Broadsheet Access - for city guide powerhouse, Broadsheet Media.

Broadsheet required a trusted partner to design and build the digital home for everything relating to its new Access membership. 

Bringing users the very best of their city through breaking news, features, event guides and insight from industry experts, Broadsheet is the leading authority on cultural life in major cities throughout Australia. 

Their aim is not simply to tell their users about a restaurant opening, they will spend time in the kitchen, chatting with chefs over the clatter of pans, and to the designers while admiring their drawings. By telling their audience who’s making places so great and why, and where they can find them, they add insight into what makes a city truly tick.

With the new subscription program from $6.50 per month, Access members can get first dibs on event tickets and table reservations at the hottest restaurants. They can enjoy unique experiences alongside exclusive discounts and offers from a selection of handpicked brands.

After Clock was approached to help build and deliver the new membership platform and with an ambition to launch to market ASAP, we adopted a rapid approach to development, prioritising the deliverables and setting to work straight away. Using our FrontEnd expertise to finely craft and interpret the high-level designs, we created a beautifully presented fully responsive digital platform that offers a simple yet seamless user experience. Members can redeem rewards with our in-built redemption mechanics as well as navigate from the main Broadsheet platform with ease, via integrated SSO. Furthermore, with the city-picker, a user can see content that is most relevant to their chosen location.

Harnessing the feature set of Clock’s CMS components and with a simple set of Phase 1 requirements, we were able to create a working solution within weeks. 

2022 will see the platform continue to evolve, with an exciting roadmap of new features and functionality that will enhance the user experience and allow the site to become even more reflective of the Broadsheet brand and all it has to offer.
